Description: Compile inline 'C' code and easily call with
 automatically generated wrapper functions.  By allowing user-defined headers
 and compilation flags (preprocessor, compiler and linking flags) the user 
 can configure optimization options and linking to third party 
 libraries. Multiple functions may be defined in a single block of code - which 
 may be defined in a string or a path to a source file.
