`{callme}` compiles C code to loadable dynamic libraries callable via `.Call()`.
This is useful for rapid prototyping of C code.

Code is defined in a character string, and must be valid C code callable
via `.Call()`.

Features:

* Simple. Purpose is to support `.Call()` only.
* Straightforward. Requires user to submit complete C code - including header `#include` 
  directives.
* Flexible. Includes explicit handling for `PKG_CPPFLAGS` and `PKG_LIBS` for setting 
  C pre-processor flags, and library linking flags so code can link to other libraries 
  installed on the system.
* Returned object includes auto-generated functions wrapping the C functions in 
  the code which are compatible with `.Call()`.  Not
  strictly necessary, but nice to have!

### What's in the box

* `callme(code, cpp_flags = NULL, ld_flags = NULL, verbose = FALSE)` compile and load the function into R.

### What's new


#### v0.1.5  2023-07-21

* Stricter checks for auto-generation of wrappers for `.Call()`-compatible C functions.

#### v0.1.4  2023-07-21

* Return a more useful object which contains wrapper functions for 
  all the C functions which adhere to `.Call()` syntax
    * Really useful for interactive use as function names and arguments 
      are easily accessed via auto-complete.


### Limitations

* As required by `.Call()` 
    * the C functions must only take `SEXP` arguments, and return a `SEXP` value.


## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/callme) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/callme')
```

## Example

The following example compiles a code snippet into a C library and then 
executes the function from R using `.Call()`.

The function name in C is `add_`, which means that this is the first argument to
`.Call()` i.e. `.Call("add_", ...)`.

The function name could be almost any valid C function name, but I prefer to 
use an underscore suffix to indicate that this a C function meant to be called from R.

```{r example_simple, eval = TRUE}
library(callme)

code <- "
#include <R.h>
#include <Rdefines.h>

SEXP add_(SEXP val1_, SEXP val2_) {
  return ScalarReal(asReal(val1_) + asReal(val2_));
}
"

# Keep reference to returned object.
# C library will be unloaded when 'dll' variable is garbage collected.
dll <- callme(code)

# Manual call
.Call("add_", 1, 2.5)

# Wrapper function automatically generated by 'callme()'
dll$add_(99.5, 0.5)
```




## Linking against an installed library

In this example we want to get the version of the `zstd` library which is
(already) installed on the computer, and return it as a character string.

We need to tell R when compiling the code:

* to look in the `/opt/homebrew/include` directory for `zstd.h`.
* to look for the actual `zstd` library in `/opt/homebrew/lib`.
* to link to the `zstd` library (`-lzstd`)

Note: This if for `zstd` installed via `homebrew` on macOS.  Paths will 
be different for other operating systems.

```{r eval=TRUE}
  code <- r"(
#include <R.h>
#include <Rdefines.h>
#include "zstd.h"
  
SEXP version_() {
  return mkString(ZSTD_versionString());
}
)"

# Keep reference to returned object.
# C library will be unloaded when 'dll' variable is garbage collected.
dll <- callme(code, cpp_flags = "-I/opt/homebrew/include", ld_flags = "-L/opt/homebrew/lib -lzstd")

# Manual call
.Call("version_")

# Wrapper function automatically generated by 'callme()'
dll$version_()
```
